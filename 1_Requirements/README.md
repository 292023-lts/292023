# Requirements
This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement efficient data structures and provides me flexibilty to understand multiple C programming concepts.

# Explanation:
Hospital Management Application have few inbuilt features like:

Create a patient record
Delete a patient record
Read a patient record
Update a patient record
Save record to file
Read record from file

Since we have assumed that few systems already exists we can say that in future sprints new features could be added in which for instance patient record from PMS can be sent to HMS or Analytics or even to emegency services if some patient record shows abnormal pattern.
